- 
- Hello and welcome! I'm a data analyst, mathematics specialist, a skateboarder, and a world traveler.
- I am currently employed as a Product Data Specialist at Rexel Canada Electric Inc., where I am involved in the development of a Product Information Management (PIM) system for E-Commerce. My objective is to contribute to the creation of a modern and intelligent back-end system that enables our business customers to access all the essential product information they require.
- I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. My undergraduate studies provided me with a comprehensive introduction to various fields of mathematics, including Analysis, Algebra, Number Theory, Graph Theory, and Game Theory. Additionally, I have taken courses in statistics and applied mathematics that emphasized practical applications, such as Multivariate Linear Regression, Time Series Analysis, and Non-linear Optimization. These courses, along with my previous employment at Deloitte, have equipped me with rigorous reasoning and analytical skills.
- When I'm not working or engaged in research projects, I enjoy spending my free time skateboarding and traveling around the world. In 2023, I embarked on a road trip that spanned across the entire North America. It began in Toronto, where I drove along the Trans-Canada Highway all the way to Vancouver. From there, I continued along US Route 101 and US Highway 1, making my way down to Los Angeles. Afterwards, I followed the historic US Highway 66 to Chicago before finally returning to Toronto. Along this epic journey, I visited several major cities, including Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, Chicago, and Detroit.
